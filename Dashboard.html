        <p>The brain is a really tricky organ. It is responsible for bodily functions and can also serve
            a protective role. This is evident among people who've faced trauma. By trauma, I don't 
            necessarily mean sad experiences. Our brains are wired to keep certain experiences from us
            and sometimes this manifests as memory loss. With TimeLight, we offer you a chance to preserve
            important moments and memories. We beleive that each experience, each humanly moments created 
            needs to be cherished and preserved.
